                    <h4>What is Anemia?</h4>
                    <p>Hello parents. Today, I would like to talk to you about a big sickness (disease). About the sickness our people call “tapeworm” in Todos Santos, but here in the United States, it is called <b>anemia</b>.</p>
                    <h4>What is the disease called anemia?</h4>
                    <p>When the doctor tells you your child has anemia, what does the doctor mean? The doctor is telling you there isn’t enough of a particular cell in your child’s blood. The cell is called a red blood cell. The doctor is telling you there aren’t enough cells—the cells called red blood cells—in your child’s blood.</p>
                    <h4>What is a cell?</h4>
                    <p>Cells are very small and alive. Your entire body is alive due to cells, and there are a few cells that live in your blood. Just like a house is built, you are also built. A house is made of cement; you are made of cells.</p>
                    <p>Your hands are alive by cells; your entire body is made of cells, and there are cells living in your blood. Those cells that live in your blood are called red blood cells!</p>
                    <h4>Why do our bodies want there to be a lot of red blood cells in our body?</h4>
                    <p>Red blood cells have a very important job. Their job is to take oxygen all over the body. Because there are red blood cells in the blood, where the blood goes, the red blood cells follow. The red blood cells that are inside the blood carry oxygen, so where the cells go, oxygen goes. Red blood cells work really hard to carry oxygen where the body wants.</p>
                    <h4>Why does our body ask a lot for oxygen? And why does our body ask for our red blood cells to work hard to carry oxygen all over our bodies?</h4>   
                    <p>It is oxygen that gives our bodies energy.For our bodies to have energy, oxygen is necessary; for our bodies to move well, oxygen is necessary to have in the body. That is why our bodies ask a lot for oxygen. Our body's relationship with oxygen is that of a car. Like a car that runs on gasoline, our bodies move on oxygen.</p>
                    <p>Have you noticed how many times you breathe in a day or in an hour? We breathe so often to inhale oxygen all the way to our lungs. When the oxygen arrives in our lungs, it is then picked up by the red blood cells. Once the red blood cells have oxygen, they then carry it to where the body needs it.</P>
                    <p>When you want to pick up an object that is very heavy with your hands, it is the red blood cells that bring oxygen all the way from the lungs to the hands. When the oxygen makes it to the hands, then the hands will have enough energy to pick up the object.</p>
                    <h4>The red blood cells work really hard with transporting oxygen. But what exactly gives red blood cells the energy to work well and efficiently?</h4>
                    <p>Red blood cells have enough energy because of a mineral called iron. Allowing them to work well and efficiently in our bodies. Iron is what gives red blood cells the strength to transport oxygen wherever the body needs it.</p> 
                    <h4>We know that oxygen comes from the air, but where does iron come from? Where does the mineral called iron come from so that it can give red blood cells energy?</h4>
                    <p>Iron comes from food. There are a lot of foods that have iron in them. It can be found in meats like pork, chicken, cow, and even sheep. There is a lot of iron that comes from meat.</p>
                    <p>Iron can be found in beans, potatoes, eggs, squash, broccoli, cabbage, and even mushrooms. These as well have a lot of iron. When you eat foods that are rich in iron, you will have enough iron in your body. That is the reason why the doctor tells you to give kids a lot of foods rich in iron.</p>
                    <h4>When a child does not eat foods rich in iron, they get sick with the disease called anemia. What else can cause anemia?</h4>
                    <p>When a child loses a lot of blood, they also lose a lot of red blood cells that are in the blood. They then develop the disease called anemia. That is why it is not good for a child or an adult to lose a lot of blood.</p>
                    <p>When a woman begins to menstruate, she loses a lot of blood; that too can cause the disease called anemia. When a child bleeds a lot from the nose for a week, that as well can cause the disease called anemia. When you do not eat foods rich in iron and you lose a lot of blood, this can cause the disease anemia.</p>
                    <h4>How does the doctor find out that a child has anemia?</h4>
                    <p>The child will feel fatigued if they have anemia. Also, their body, face, eyes, or nails will get paler. Also, if the child feels dizzy and breath heavily after running just a little. Their hands and legs will feel very cold because of the anemia. They will experience headaches, and their hearts will beat fast.</p>
                    <h4>How does the doctor verify if a child has anemia?</h4>
                    <p>The doctor will ask to get the child's blood drawn. When the child's blood is drawn, it will be analyzed. The analysis will show if the child has or does not have anemia in their body.</p>
                    <h4>Once the doctor finds out that the child has anemia, he will be the one to say which medication can be given to the child for the anemia.</h4>
                    <p>The doctor will tell the parents what foods rich in iron to give to the child. Also, the doctor will say which type of iron vitamins will be given to the child. Iron vitamins can be given in liquid or tablet form. Don’t forget that iron is what gives the red blood cells energy to work well in our bodies. Iron pills are quite strong, so you might notice that your child’s bowel movements appear very dark or black. Don’t be alarmed—this is normal and happens because of taking iron supplements.</p>
                    <h4>Many Guatemalan children suffer from anemia, but it can be treated by eating iron-rich foods or taking iron vitamins. If you have any questions about anemia, you can ask your doctor at La Clinca de la Raza about it. The doctor is a good person, he can help you with your child’s health.</h4>
